# Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Quantum Annealing implementation

## Introduction
This work is a python implementation of [O'Gorman et al.](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjst/e2015-02349-9) `Bayesian Network Structure Learning` encoding into a `Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation` (`QUBO`) problem.
The encoded `QUBO` problem is solved using either a `Simulated Annealing` or `Quantum Annealing` approach using the libraries and `quantum annealers` provided by [D-Wave Systems](https://www.dwavesys.com/).
